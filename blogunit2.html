                    <li>Index.html</li>
                    <p>This page contains my about me, as standard for my blog it includes a nav bar and the trioptimum logo as a background, a fictional company from the video game, System Shock.
                        After a brief welcome to my blog there’s a paragraph or two about myself, and then two videos that I produced myself and uploaded to youtube, which contains two speedruns of games I’ve played, one of which happens to be system shock.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li>Blog.html</li>
                        <p>This page as standard has the nav bar across the top and the same background image. However a major difference is the music player that I added, I noted that a lot of people suggest that auto playing music can be a negative feature of the website, so I made the music somewhat mellow so that it wasn’t too surprising and/or jarring.
                            If you scroll you’ll also notice it will stick to your screen as you scroll, A simple thing but allows you to control music wherever you are.
                            This page has a list of unit 1 outcome 1 in order, separated by headers of the specific outcome names, rounding out the bottom of the page is a link to the top of the page to bring you back to the top, in addition, there’s all the references I used for outcome 1, the name blog.html comes as it was the first page I made when creating this blog.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <li>Blogout2.html</li>
                            <p>This page is exactly the same as Unit 1 outcome one, however, it lists the unit 1 outcome 2 section</p>
                            <br>
                            <li>Blogout3.html</li>
                            <p>And this page is the same as the two before it, only this time it contains outcome 3</p>
                            <li>blogUnit2.html</li>
                            <p>Unit 2 is much like Unit 1, the nav bar across the top and the same background image throughout, with its own link to take you to the top of the page near the bottom.
                                The main difference being is that the page blogunit2.html imaginatively contains the unit 2 outcomes and references used in unit 2. Somethint to note is that I kept the naming convention I had started from blog.html and appended unit2 as well as out2/3 to the other pages to differentiate them.

                    <p class="paratext">When it comes to copyright, it’s generally best practice to assume its under copyright, therefore it’s best to explore creation of your own images. When a copyright claim is made, it’s considered standard to remove the infringing material as soon as possible, as seen under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>

                        When a claim complaint is made, it should be responded to, to assure the potential copyright holder that the claim is being investigated.
                        Finally to ensure you are able to use copyrighted material, ensure you have written permission from the copyright holder, or otherwise investigate that it is under fair use. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a></p>

                      When designing a website it's generally a good idea to consider users who are shortsighted or hard of seeing, or various states of colourblindness.
                      The best way to tackle these would be through larger font options, and colourblind options.

                  <h2>1.7</h2>
                  <h2>Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites></h2>
                  <div class="parabox">
                    <p class="paratext">
                        To begin with, I'll explore the basic file types necessary to run a webpage. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>
                        .Html is your primary filetype for browsing the internet, standing for hyper text markup language, a .html file will instruct your browser on how to display the contents of an html document using elements. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, produced in 2014. 
                        <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>
                        <br>
                        .css is a file that stands for cascading style sheet, when creating pages with .html the style of the page had to be defined within each html document, which would often be a painful process. .css allows for the style of the page to be defined in one location and then the .html file will pull the style information for each web page from a singular location. <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to these two basic files, there’s also other files that you may choose to put into your website, such as image files, or audio.
                        <br>
                        In fact, most file types are appropriate for websites, any browser that was made in the last 5 years can handle a variety of file types, so it comes down to preference at that point.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         To begin with images, png is objectively better than jpegs for images, the artifacting present in repeated opening of jpegs and the overall quality loss for compression reasons, but in this day and age, image files do not need to be compressed unless you live in the USA where you live with download limits, and even then the size difference between png and jpeg is so negligible that you wouldn’t consider it to be an issue .Gifs are also a valid file type to play a short animation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Audio file types are generally all the same to the average user, although .flac is to be avoided for websites as the benefit isn’t really worth it for something only audiophiles will appreciate, best to stick with .mp3 files
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        .webm files have started to gain popularity for displaying videos as the quality of the video is superior and are strong competition for the current industry standard of .mp4, however support for .webm is coming in somewhat slowly and some browsers and iphones may not run a .webm, however taking into account the market share of iphones is lesser than android, which does support .webm, you may find that an acceptable compromise. <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        .pdfs can be run in browser as modern browsers have built in javascript to display .pdfs
                        In summary, it’s safe to assume that most file types are appropriate unless they’re for a highly specialised non-consumer software.
