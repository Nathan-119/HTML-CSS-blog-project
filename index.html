<h1>Welcome to Nathan's Blog!</h1>

<h2>About me!</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Nathan, otherwise known as AirNathan119 around the internet, I'm a 26 year old graduate in Biomedical Science, and I'm expanding my passion for technology by undertaking a course with Codenation. After leaving college with a BTEC in Applied Science I begun to teach myself about computers, delving into the hardware side of things foremost, building my own computer and stipping down and rebuilding whatever devices I could get my hands on, shortly afterwards you would find me browsing around the internet to learn about to software side of things and experimenting with installing linux and self teaching myself whilst graduating university, post graduation I momentarily dropped my hobby to focus on my career.

    <br>
After a short stint working a few jobs that felt ultimately unfulfilling. I decided I could combine my hobby with my carrer and undertook a course at codenation, the course has been everything I hoped it would be, I've been trying to learn everything I can about coding and all the software aspects of computing, in addition I'm excited to look forwards to a future working with computers.</p>

        My other hobbies inclue streaming and teaching myself the art of audio and video streaming, with the goal of  producing a high quality experience for people to watch, and it's also entertaining to chat to people about video games whilst I play.

    Here's a comparison of two videos I've done and a good example of from when I started to now, I still think I have room to grow too, so there's plenty more for me to learn.</p>
