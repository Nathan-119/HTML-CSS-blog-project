        <h2>1.1</h2>
        <h2>Describing the Purpose of IT in modern Buisness</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                IT is the heart of modern businesses, it aids with communication through emails, for many companies this
                is the primary means of communication between employees, suppliers, and customers. Other methods of
                communication include live chat system, video-conferencing systems, voice over internet protocol (VOIP)
                programs offer more and more ways to communicate for a company, whereas before this would be limited to
                perhaps the countries origin, the rise of IT allows for companies to communicate easily on a global
                scale within minutes.
                In addition to this, data handling is also made simple thanks to IT through digital storage, allowing
                for zero need for large bulky data storage like massive file cabinets with paper records, where you can
                just downsize it into a single 4 terabyte hard drive, furthermore preventing accidental data loss with
                cloud backups and portable hard drives with a copy of the original data whereas physical paper data can
                easily be damaged and lost.
                <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
        </div>
        Any business can benefit from information technology from traditional businesses such as brick and mortar
        stores, or larger businesses as discussed above resulting in increased innovation and efficiency, but also agricultural businesses, as farmers can make use of IT for production records, research, financial planning, and so on. Making the farmer and any business more efficient than they would be without these advancements in IT. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>

        <h2>1.2</h2>
        <h2>Describing methods, skills resources needed to complete projects successfully</h2>
        <p>To make a project successful, there are two categories to take into consideration, personal skills & external
            factors such as tools that you use.
            Going into the personal skills, we can look at organisational skills, and the skills needed to use tools
            such as Trello and slack, however slack would be more suitable for group projects and communicating within a group, which is
            also a good skill for a successful group project, unlike ours which is a solo project and is less necessary. Other group
            skills would include strong teamwork and knowing where to focus manpower.
            As for solo skills that would be ideal for our project, time management & planning is a strong set of skills
            to keep a project on track, being able to manage a budget prevents a project from failing due to lack of funding or
            misuse.
            Skills to use programs, for example in our project we would be using our skills in programming with html and
            css on visual code, so the skill to effectively use visual studio code and our skill with html and css will make a
            vast difference in the success of our project.
            Then there’s the tools you need to make a project successful, such a having a computer with a supported
            structure,like how a macbook has a wide range of support for coding, having the software needed to program, as
            mentioned before,in our case it is VSC.

        <h2>1.3</h2>
        <h2>Plan and carry out tsks using IT</h2>
        <p>To make a website, I will be using a Trello board to plan out my actions and measure my progress to ensure
            that I stay on track,
            a Trello board allows me to utilise the kanban method
            <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>
            to achieve this, to help visualise my progress and understand where I am at in the
            project in a meaningful way. I can sort my tasks into lists of to-do, doing and done, and organise them as
            needed. Furthermore if I need to bring in team members I can share a link to the Trello board with them,
            then they can immediately edit the board and work on tasks as needed, I can also invite people to view my
            Trello board and view my progress, as seen here.

    <div>
        <h2>1.4</h2>
        <h2>Describing the risks that might imapct digital projects</h2>
        <p>The failure of digital projects tends to revolve around funding mismanagement, and time mismanagement, take
            as an example the case of Star Citizen, a project that has had funding of over $229 million to this date, and has been
            in production since 2012, yet the game remains in an Alpha state at the time of writing. <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>
            <br>
            Other reasons could be due to network failures if team members are unable to communicate, or lack
            of skills amongst the individual team members if they lack the skills to perform the required
            tasks then there will be a resulting bottleneck of tasks being performed, but a build up of tasks
            needed to be done that are lacking anyone with the skills to perform them.
            In addition, power failure could be a potential loss of data, and can disrupt workflow.
            Another potential issue is the chance of having malware corrupt a system, at best, this would cause delays, at worst, loss of data, leading into that would be human error, hopefully a good project would account for human error, having checks in place to prevent human error derailing the projects progress.
            There’s also the sheer chance of outside intervention of life factors affecting team members ability to work.

        <h2>1.5</h2>
        <h2>Describing how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
        <p>When looking for the right technology and software to use, ideally you look for a platform that is well
            established, well tested, and well known to minimise risk of lack of support.
            For example, Macs are well established, looking at the app store and deluge of support pages provided by
            Apple. <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>
            Furthermore this extends into VScode which also has a wealth of online support. <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>
            So for my project I would be picking these tools and software for my project.
