            <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficency</h2>

                        <li>The benefits of IT</li>
                        Looking into the benefits of IT the main benefit is access to the internet, having a vast repository of every topic to research, it allows me to look up new coding techniques on the fly rather than having the search manually for a book, that may or may not be out of date.
                        Another benefit is that teamwork is easier, there's no requirement of being in person to work as a team, we could co-operate quite easily using github without ever having needed to have met face to face, whilst my work this time was a solo task, dividing up my work into a team would allow me to focus on one aspect of the website and produce a more polished result.

                        <br>
                        <li>The drawbacks of IT</li>
                        The drawback is needing power and wifi to perform research and work, although needing these is a far reduced downside than needing to search a library for a physical document or book for the information you need.
                        In addition, information on the internet can be unreliable or misleading, and depending on your level of knowledge it can be hard to sort correct information from incorrect information, when making the website I made sure to cross reference any information I used to ensure I wasn't being misled.
                        In comparision to a library for example, the information you're looking for is far more likely to be factual.

                    To improve productivity, studies show that music helps vastly with productivity. <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
This study shows that listening to music whilst performing tasks results in better ideas and faster production, therefore I listened to music throughout this project. I chose music with energetic beats and fast rhythms, like artists such as The Protomen, GosT, Magic Sword and Perturbator.
<br>
In addition, the study tells us that lyrics distract listeners, pop music and music that is forced upon the listener is a big detriment to productivity, I took this into account in my music choices, picking music where lyrics were not the focus, and avoiding the public speaker playing pop music in the classroom.

Being organised through the use of Trello and the kanban method helped keep me on task and not derail my project through over ambition.
Trello allows me to make tasks in “cards” and this allows me to divide up my work into bite size chunks, compentmartializing my work and allowing me to visualise my progress by increments, then by dividing my cards into to-do, doing & done, otherwise known as the kanban method, I can easily see my progress throughout the project, and ultimately I feel as though it helps me to not feel as though there is no end in sight to the project and not suffer burnout.

                        To improve my productivity I would use Trello and Slack to assign various units and webpages to different team members, one person could write the .css, one person could write the .html for a page, another person for another page, multiple people could write up the units, I think dividing up the work like that would have been more efficient.
                        <br>
                        Using Slack to share potential images, fonts, backgrounds, coding concepts to improve the site and educate each other to learn how to better program the site.

                        I went about testing the site initially through using the site myself, checking the websites functions after each change. Further on into the project, when looking at areas I feel that I’m weak in, such as art direction, I showed my website to other people on the course and asked for their critique, as I’d been teaching them how to make a nav bar, and use .css properly I wasn’t really too concerned with having ideas stolen or anything such as that.
                        <br>
                        I also shared the website using the github page link with friends outside the course looking for feedback.
