# HTML-CSS-blog-project
A Project for Codenation
It's a website designed to show what I've learned at code nation and meet the critera for the marking grade.
I threw this together in about 3 days, probably could have done heaps more with more time & training.
I'm happy with it to some degree, it's a working website after all and passes the course, but there's a lot more I feel I could have done with it.
