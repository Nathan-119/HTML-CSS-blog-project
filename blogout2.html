                        When making my website I was dubious to the benefits of Trello as when doing previous team work it was hard to get my team to engage with Trello and use it effectively, but since using it as part of a solo project I’ve found it very beneficial, and it leaves me optimistic that a team that understands how to effetively use Trello would make a project far more effective. 
                        <br>
                        When using Visual Studio Code (VSC) I’ve found zero problems with the program, it has source control to allow me to push and pull to & from github without having ever needing to enter anything in the terminal which is very handy. It just works and I probably could have added some extensions to make my coding more effective given more time to experiment.

            <h2>2.2</h2>

            <div class="parabox">
                    <p class="paratext">
                    Given my limited knowledge of coding, I’m not sure that I’m qualified to say that these tools were appropriate, but for myself, I felt as though they met all the expectations I had.
                    <br>
                    VSC fulfilled the purpose of writing code, Trello served it's purpose of helping me stay organised, Github allowed me to work effectively wherever I was. 
                    <br>
                    I don't think I have any complaints to make about any program in the making of this website.

            <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
            <div class="parabox">
                    <p class="paratext">
                            I’m pretty pleased with the final outcome of my website, having spoke to an experienced coder and been told it is of BTEC level 3 Distinction level, I feel as though I’m happy with the result this being my third week of having ever written any code.
                            <br>
                            To be honest, I’d probably reconsider the colour scheme, it’s very dark and moody, whilst I like that atmosphere in the videogame the background comes from, I think it's not so ideal for a blog, so something more lighter and uplifting, or a choice in pallettes would be ideal, perhaps I could add parallax scrolling, but it would be too busy for further improvements I would plan to make for a blog to be a blog, so I would expect to use parallax scrolling sparsely, and the shift in style may be too offputting.

            <h2>2.4</h2>

            <div class="parabox">
                    <p class="paratext">
                            For further improvments I could make, well it’s a blog after all, so a comment system for readers would be ideal, and a system where I could update my blog with my latest goings on, with new pages for my blog that is dated efficiently without needing to go into VSC and creating a whole new page, essentially automating the system of creating new pages and filling them in with a standardised format, perhaps also a contact page so that people may contact me outside the blog.
                            <br>
                            As of right now, I feel that what is in place is merely the basics for what a blog needs to be called a blog.

                                    I planned out my website on Trello and completed it in VSC.

                                    Using the navigation bar at the top of the screen it is a simple matter to view content and navigate to various pages, in addition I added a button to return to the top of the screen if needed.

                                    I added .mp3 files and .jpeg files with the express purpose of using them on my website as I knew they would work.
